CM6206 + Voicemeeter + Bass Shakers (7 transducers over 7.1)
===========================================================

Goal
----
1) CM6206 should NOT force itself as Windows default audio device.
2) Windows audio can play normally to your main speakers/headphones.
3) The same audio is also sent to the CM6206, but filtered to BASS ONLY and distributed across its 7.1 outputs to match your amps/transducers.

Your wiring (CM6206 -> amps)
---------------------------
AMP#1 (2.1 seat + sub)
- Front Left  (FL)  -> Seat Left transducer
- Front Right (FR)  -> Seat Right transducer
- Sub/LFE     (LFE) -> 50W sub transducer

AMP#2 (back)
- Rear Left   (RL)  -> Back Left transducer
- Rear Right  (RR)  -> Back Right transducer

AMP#3 (feet)
- Side Left   (SL) OR Center (FC) -> Feet Left transducer
- Side Right  (SR)              -> Feet Right transducer

Recommended: use Side Left/Side Right for the feet pair (SL/SR).


Part A — Stop the "make me default" behavior
--------------------------------------------
Best: do NOT install the vendor control-panel (Xear Audio Center) at all.
If you must install it, the mod in this workspace changes its config so it should not try to control default devices.

Also on Windows:
- Settings -> System -> Sound -> choose your real listening device as Default, not the CM6206.
- Sound Control Panel -> Communications tab -> set "Do nothing".


Part B — Set CM6206 to 7.1 correctly
------------------------------------
1) Control Panel -> Sound -> Playback -> select the CM6206 "Speakers" device -> Configure
2) Pick "7.1 Surround".
3) Enable the speakers you actually use:
	- Front L/R, Rear L/R, Side L/R, Subwoofer
	- Center can be off (unless you decide to use Center for Feet Left).
4) In Properties -> Advanced:
	- Set 48000 Hz (48 kHz) if possible.
	- Disable Exclusive Mode if you get device-grab issues (optional, depends on your apps).


Part C — Voicemeeter routing (keeps Windows default stable)
----------------------------------------------------------
1) Install Voicemeeter Banana (or Potato).
2) Set Windows Default Output to "Voicemeeter Input (VAIO)".
3) In Voicemeeter:
	- A1 = your real speakers/headphones (what you actually listen to)
	- A2 = CM6206 (WDM)
	- On the VAIO strip (the one that receives Windows audio), enable BOTH A1 and A2.

Result:
- Windows audio goes to A1 (normal listening) and A2 (CM6206) at the same time.
- Next we make A2 (CM6206) bass-only and distribute it to the 7.1 channels.


Part D — Equalizer APO (bass-only + channel distribution)
--------------------------------------------------------
This is the cleanest way to:
- remove mids/highs so shakers don’t buzz,
- create mono LFE,
- copy bass to rear/side channels so all transducers can run from normal stereo audio.

1) Install Equalizer APO.
2) Run "Configurator" (comes with Equalizer APO) and check ONLY the CM6206 playback endpoint (Speakers).
3) Reboot if it asks.
4) Edit the Equalizer APO config for the CM6206 device.

Recommended config (bass-only shakers; directional L/R where possible)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Paste this into the CM6206’s Equalizer APO config. If the channel names differ on your system,
see the troubleshooting section at the end.

----- BEGIN EQUALIZER APO CONFIG -----
# Keep some headroom (we will sum channels for LFE)
Preamp: -10 dB

# Work on the input stereo channels (Front Left/Right)
Channel: FL FR

# Remove subsonic junk (protects transducers)
Filter: ON HP Fc 20 Hz

# Low-pass for shakers. Two stages = steeper rolloff.
Filter: ON LP Fc 80 Hz
Filter: ON LP Fc 80 Hz

# Optional: if you want a more "thumpy" feel, bump ~45 Hz a bit
# Filter: ON PK Fc 45 Hz Gain 3 dB Q 1.0

# Copy bass to the other channels you’re using
# Rear pair -> back transducers
Copy: RL=FL
Copy: RR=FR

# Side pair -> feet transducers
Copy: SL=FL
Copy: SR=FR

# LFE should be mono (sum L+R). Reduce gain to avoid clipping.
Copy: LFE=FL+FR
Channel: LFE
Gain: -6 dB

# If you want Center used (optional), uncomment and wire Feet Left to Center
# Copy: FC=0.5*FL+0.5*FR
# Channel: FC
# Gain: -3 dB
----- END EQUALIZER APO CONFIG -----


Level tuning (important)
------------------------
You’ll want different intensity per location:
- Seat usually strongest
- Back medium
- Feet usually weaker

In Equalizer APO you can add per-channel Gain after the Copy lines, e.g.:
  Channel: RL RR
  Gain: -3 dB
  Channel: SL SR
  Gain: -6 dB


Troubleshooting
---------------
1) If only the Seat transducers work (Front L/R) but Rear/Side are silent:
	- Your source is stereo (expected) and the Copy lines didn’t map to your channel names.
	- Try these alternate rear names (some setups use BL/BR instead of RL/RR):
		 Copy: BL=FL
		 Copy: BR=FR

2) If you hear mids/highs in the shakers:
	- Lower the low-pass Fc (try 70 Hz, 60 Hz).
	- Add another LP stage (a third LP at same Fc).

3) If the CM6206 still becomes default device:
	- Don’t install the vendor control panel; install driver-only.
	- Keep Windows default set to Voicemeeter Input.


Quick channel verification (do this once)
----------------------------------------
Use Windows’ built-in speaker test so you KNOW every jack->amp->transducer is correct.

1) Control Panel -> Sound -> Playback -> CM6206 Speakers -> Configure -> Test
2) When Windows plays each channel, confirm the correct transducer shakes:
	- Front Left  (FL)  = Seat Left
	- Front Right (FR)  = Seat Right
	- Subwoofer   (LFE) = 50W sub transducer
	- Rear Left   (RL)  = Back Left
	- Rear Right  (RR)  = Back Right
	- Side Left   (SL)  = Feet Left
	- Side Right  (SR)  = Feet Right
3) If any are swapped, fix it physically (cables) first. Software remaps are possible but get confusing fast.


Fallback: if you don’t want Voicemeeter
---------------------------------------
If you ONLY care about system audio feeding the shakers (and you don’t need fancy mixing):
1) Set Windows Default Output = your normal speakers/headset.
2) Install VB-Audio "Virtual Cable" (or any audio repeater tool).
3) Use a repeater to duplicate the default audio stream to the CM6206.
4) Keep Equalizer APO on CM6206 to do the bass-only filtering + channel distribution.

Voicemeeter is still the easiest because it replaces the repeater step and keeps routing stable.
